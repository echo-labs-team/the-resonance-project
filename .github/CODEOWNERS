# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
